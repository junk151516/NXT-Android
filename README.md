NXT-Android
===========
A series of demonstrations highlighting the power of various Android sensors used in conjunction with the LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT platform.  Most of these programs use Bluetooth to allow communication between the two devices, but an initial attempt at connecting the two devices used the NXT's light sensors to measure patterns on the Android phone's screen.

The Android OS targeted was 2.3, and the NXT software was written in leJOS 8.  All source code was developed using Eclipse.

These programs can be seen in action in the links to Youtube videos below:
